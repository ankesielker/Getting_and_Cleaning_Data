# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data

##Data Source from Coursera:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

##Task from Coursera:
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Instruction
With the R script run analysis the data set can be downloaded. It will be stored in the working directory and unzipped. The Code continues in the same working directory, you will not need to set a new working directory - unless you store data separately.

Loading the script run_Analysis.R you can start working with the data set immediately.
